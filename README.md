Mensch Ã¤rgere Dich nicht (English: Man, Don't Get Angry) is a German board game developed by Josef Friedrich Schmidt in 1907/1908.
The name derives from the fact that a peg is sent back to the "out" field when another peg lands on it, similar to the later game Sorry!.

More information about the game can be found at the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch_%C3%A4rgere_Dich_nicht).

## Project idea
Idea of the project is to create an electronic version of the game to help promoting STEM education (and to have some fun of course).

## Main features

Main features of the projects:
- based on popular ATmega328p microcontroller used on Arduino boards
- WS2812B-V5 addressable LEDs with no external components needed
- touchpads for controling the game
- Piezo buzzer for audio queues
- 3000mAh rechargable Li-Po battery
- USB-C connector for charging and programming the microcontroller

## 3D renders

## PCBs
There are 3 different PCBs:

**BoardGame** - main 150x150mm PCB that contains LEDs and most of the electronic components (1 needed)

**Dice** - small PCB used as a touchpad (1 needed)

## Enclosure
There are few 3D models files needed for enclosure:
1. Case - main part of the enclosure
2. FieldBoard - Upper part of the enclosure printed with black and white filaments
